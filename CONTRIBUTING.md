# Contributing

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 24 or newer
- pnpm 11.24.0, pinned by `packageManager`
- [gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks), for the pre-commit secret scan
- [cloc](https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc) and [scc](https://github.com/boyter/scc), for
  the footprint report

Run `pnpm install` after cloning. The install registers the lefthook Git hooks.

## Quality gates

Pull requests run formatting, linting, spelling, type checking, dead-code analysis, unit
tests, the build, and the empty end-to-end harness. Run the same gates locally with:

```sh
pnpm format:check
pnpm lint
pnpm spell
pnpm typecheck
pnpm dead-code
pnpm test:unit
pnpm build
pnpm test:e2e
```

Three further jobs run alongside them. `footprint` measures the change and is described
below. `secrets` scans the pull request's commits with gitleaks. `dependencies` runs
`pnpm audit` and scans the lockfile against the OSV database; both fail on any advisory.

The pre-commit hook formats, lints, spell checks, and secret scans staged files. The
pre-push hook type checks the workspace, runs unit tests, and checks for dead code.

TypeScript uses strict checking, unchecked indexed access checks, and erasable syntax.
Biome uses its recommended rules plus the published
[`noExcessiveCognitiveComplexity`](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-excessive-cognitive-complexity/)
rule and its standard limit, which is the complexity gate. Unknown words go in the `words`
list in `cspell.json`.

## Footprint, comment load and bundle size

The `footprint` job reports lines added, removed and changed in four buckets, each split
into code and comments: product code from `apps/` and `packages/`, test code, build
tooling, and everything else, which is where configuration, documentation and the lock
file land. The total covers the first three, so a lock file rewrite is reported without
drowning the lines somebody wrote. The same report carries the cyclomatic complexity of
each bucket on both sides of the comparison, the comment-to-code ratio against the merge
base, and the absolute bundle size against the ratchet in `.size-limit.json`.

It goes to the run summary of every pull request, and to one pull request comment that is
updated in place as commits land. A pull request from a fork gets the run summary only,
because its token cannot write comments.

Two of the figures gate the merge. Comment load may not exceed the merge base, and no
bundle may exceed its ratchet. Raising a ratchet means editing `.size-limit.json`, which
is a reviewed line in the diff. When either fails, the report names both ways through
rather than only the verdict.

The cyclomatic figure gates nothing. It is scc's estimate, counted from branch and loop
keywords rather than from a syntax tree, and it is there so that complexity growth is as
visible as line growth. Complexity that fails a build is cognitive complexity, caught by
Biome above.

No figure here is an absolute this project invented. See
[ADR 6](docs/adr/0006-gates-cite-a-standard-or-measure-a-regression.md) for why each is
shaped the way it is, why the counter is cloc rather than scc or tokei, and what the
comment-load gate means while the merge base still carries no comments.

Run the report locally against a built tree:

```sh
pnpm build
pnpm footprint
```

It compares `HEAD` with its merge base against `origin/main`. Pass `--base` and `--head`
to compare something else, and `--out` to write the Markdown to a file.

## The nightly mutation gate

A test that cannot fail is worse than no test, because it reports safety it does not
provide, and nothing static tells one apart from a test that works. Mutation testing does:
it changes the code and asks whether the suite notices. `stryker.config.json` mutates the
`src` of every workspace package, and `.github/workflows/nightly.yml` fails on any mutant
no test kills. Nothing is carved out of that: a file the unit suite does not judge shows
up as an uncovered mutant and fails the run just as a survivor does.

The run is scheduled rather than attached to pull requests, and is deliberately not a
required check. It re-judges all of the code against all of the tests every time, so it
costs more than a pull request should carry and it never inherits a verdict from an
earlier run.

Run it locally with `pnpm test:mutation`. Two of its settings are less redundant than they
look. The vitest runner is named in `plugins` because Stryker resolves its own plugin
search against its package directory, which under pnpm holds no siblings to find. And
`inPlace` mutates the working tree for the length of the run rather than a copy of it,
because the copy is prepared by rewriting `tsconfig.json` through a TypeScript API that
TypeScript 7 no longer exposes. A run killed part way leaves the mutated files behind;
`git restore .` puts them back.

## The Core import ban

`packages/core` must stay portable to any runtime, so it may not reach for the DOM,
React, React Native, or a runtime-specific API. Two gates hold that.

Its `tsconfig.json` sets `lib` to the language alone and `types` to nothing, so no
runtime's globals are declared to it. `document`, `window`, `caches`, `process` and
everything else supplied by a host rather than by the language are undeclared, and using
one is a type error. Core therefore has no `fetch` either: what it needs from a host
arrives as an injected dependency typed by core itself, which is the shape that keeps it
portable.

A Biome override on `packages/core/**` then covers what the compiler cannot see.
`noRestrictedImports` rejects React, React Native, Expo, Node, Cloudflare and sibling
workspace packages. `noRestrictedGlobals` rejects the host globals by name, which matters
because a single `/// <reference lib="dom" />` re-declares the whole DOM to the compiler
and the type error disappears.

See [ADR 3](docs/adr/0003-separate-view-layers-shared-core.md) for why.

## Dependency updates

Renovate runs self-hosted from `.github/workflows/renovate.yml`, so no GitHub App has to
be installed on the repository. Its first run opens an onboarding pull request that adds
the shared configuration.

The workflow falls back to its own token, which cannot update files under
`.github/workflows` and whose pull requests do not start a CI run. Set a `RENOVATE_TOKEN`
repository secret to a personal access token with the `repo` and `workflow` scopes to
lift both limits.

`overrides` in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` lifts a transitive dependency past an advisory its
own package pins below. It holds `qs` above
[GHSA-q8mj-m7cp-5q26](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-q8mj-m7cp-5q26), which reaches
the workspace through Stryker. An entry is removable once the package that pins it
releases a version that does not.
