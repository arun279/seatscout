# seatscout

Find the seat you actually want, across every cinema chain near you, in one search.

Most ticketing apps make you pick a chain, then a theater, then a screening, and only
then show you a seating chart. If you care about *where you sit*, that is the wrong order:
you end up opening four apps and checking twenty screenings to find one good pair of seats.

seatscout inverts it. Describe what you want, including where in the room you want to be,
and it returns specific seats at specific screenings, ranked, across every nearby chain at
once.

> "Insidious in Dolby, Friday or Saturday evening, two seats together, good middle, within
> fifteen miles."

## Status

Early development. Not yet usable.

## What makes it different

**Results are seats, not screenings.** A screening with nothing but front-row singles left
is not a result, however well it matches on film, time, and location.

**"Good seats" has an engineering definition.** The default seat profile targets two thirds
of the way back on the centreline. That is where SMPTE ST 202 places the reference
microphone and where THX-certified auditoriums are calibrated, so it is the seat the mix
was balanced for. It penalises the front rows, the back row, and seats beyond SMPTE's
15 degree lateral comfort limit. Every part of it is adjustable.

**Auditoriums are compared on equal terms.** Seat positions are normalised to a depth from
0.0 at the screen to 1.0 at the back, and a lateral from -1.0 to +1.0 across. "Middle"
means the same thing in a 300-seat premium house and a 40-seat dine-in room, and it is
derived from real seat geometry rather than from row letters, which are not reliably
ordered and are sometimes not letters at all.

**Partial results say so.** Upstream requests fail sometimes. A search that could not check
every candidate screening reports its coverage, because a short list that looks complete is
indistinguishable from an empty room.

**Nothing about you is stored on a server.** Preferences and history live on your device.
The hosted component is a stateless proxy that exists only because browsers cannot call the
upstream source directly. Native clients do not use it at all.

## Booking

seatscout finds seats and hands off to the operator's own checkout with the screening
selected. It does not process payments and never stores card details. See
[ADR 4](docs/adr/0004-booking-ends-at-a-deep-link.md).

## Self-hosting

The deployment holds no user data and has effectively no secrets. Running your own instance
means your own hosting account and your own access allowlist. Instructions will land with
the first release.

## Documentation

- [CONTEXT.md](CONTEXT.md) is the domain vocabulary. Code and tests use these words and no
  synonyms. Read it before changing anything.
- [docs/adr](docs/adr) records the decisions that are hard to reverse and would otherwise
  look arbitrary.
